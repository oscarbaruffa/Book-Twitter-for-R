THIS BOOK IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION You can subscribe to Oscar’s newsletter to be notified of major updates to the book. The R community is very active on Twitter. You can learn a lot about the language, about new approaches to problems, make friends and even land a job or next contract. It’s a real-time pulse of the R community.

Artwork by @allison_horst 1.1 What you can get out of Twitter So, you’re an R-programmer. What can you gain from becoming active on Twitter? First of all, what is Twitter exactly? It’s a microblogging and social media website that started in 2006. Messages on this platform are called tweets, and have a maximum length of 280 characters (used to be 140 characters). On Twitter, you base your decision to follow someone on whether you think their content is interesting. Unlike Facebook, Twitter is not based on who you know in real life. 1.1.1 The friendly R community The online R community is known as a friendly bunch! Some even say it’s the greatest benefit of using R. It’s OK to ask questions, people support each other and are genuinly happy for each other if there is good news to share. Connecting to the online #rstats Twitter community can be especially useful if you’re the only one using R in your company or institution. Twitter is a fantastic resource for learning new tips and tricks with #R, especially when it comes to #dataviz! I love how supportive the #rstats community is. 🤓 https://t.co/9qMwbXkvEQ — Julian Gan (@JCLGan) February 17, 2020 1.1.2 Keeping up with what’s going down Twitter is a great source for news. It allows you to keep up with the release of new packages, job opportunities and conferences. Lots of people in the R community have blogs, and they will tweet about it if they published a new blog post. But it’s not all so serious, there is also room for some lighter content. Joking about the things we all struggle with as R programmers strengthens the sense of community. Goodnight columns, goodnight rows,Goodnight kind strangers on Stack Overflow,Goodnight factors, goodnight strings,Goodnight overfitted things,Goodnight humans, goodnight bots,Goodnight inconclusive plots.Goodnight R 😴#rstats — Olga Boichak (@olgarithmic) October 30, 2018 Tidy Tuesday (more about this later in the book) 1.1.3 Encouragement Everybody struggles sometimes, and that’s OK. Support network The only way to write good code is to write tons of shitty code first. Feeling shame about bad code stops you from getting to good code — Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) April 17, 2015 1.1.4 Making friends on Twitter (it’s a real thing) Maybe it’s hard to picture if you haven’t used Twitter before, but it’s a place where you can actually make a real connection with other people. Sometimes you get to meet the friends you made on Twitter in real life, eg. at a conference. Person at an event: oh hi, I know you from twitterMe: …sorry remind me?Person: says his name, full job title, things we talked aboutMe: …er…?Person: my profile picture is a banana?Me: Banana!!! How are you?! So great to meet in real life! — Robyn Vinter (@RobynVinter) February 7, 2020 Now you know what Twitter can bring you as an R programmer, we’ll move on to making a Twitter account and find the first people to follow.

["follow-some-folks.html", "2 Follow some folks 2.1 Following people and organisations 2.2 How to unfollow people", " 2 Follow some folks Let’s start by downloading the Twitter app on your phone, or visiting the desktop site. Create an account and you’re good to go. When your first start, you’ll be prompted to follow some popular accounts. Go ahead and select a few. Don’t worry about which you select, we’ll show you how to unfollow accounts later. For now, just pick a few and continue. The key to making Twitter work for you is to follow accounts that you find interesting. Accounts can be owned either by individuals or admistered by companies. Twitter will often recommend accounts for you to follow. Some may be relevant, so go ahead and follow them. Over time, you’ll find that you follow more and more accounts. 2.1 Following people and organisations You can find people to follow by searching for their Twitter handle. This is a unique identifier associated with each account. For example, Allison Horst’s tag is “@allison_horst”. Comparing scenarios &amp; connecting sample differences to p-values to evidence for population differences. pic.twitter.com/9qrHVoDS76 — Allison Horst (@allison_horst) January 12, 2020 Tags are the basis for interacting with other accounts on Twitter. When you want to mention someone in a tweet, a tag is how you’ll do it. We’ll do some practice tweeting soon! We’ve listed a few accounts for you to follow and get some practice at the same time. These are some prominent members of the R community and they post good stuff. Go ahead and search for these accounts and follow them. Let’s walk you through the first one. Select the search bar (the magnifying glass icon 🔍 ) Search for Hadley Wickham by typing @hadleywickham in the search bar. Hadley’s profile will come up. Select it. Select the follow button. Well done! You’ve followed your first person :). Now go ahead and follow a few other prominent R-people: Mara Averick: @dataandme Caitlin Hudon: @beeonaposy Thomas Mock: @thomas_mock Gina Reynolds: @EvaMaeRey Jenny Bryan: @JennyBryan There are also great organisational accounts: R4DS online learning community: @R4DScommunity R-Ladies Global: @RLadiesGlobal You may start remembering people by their Twitter handle rather than their actual name! Oh yes, you can also go ahead and follow Oscar and Veerle if you’d like to :). Oscar Baruffa: @oscarbaruffa Veerle van Son: @veerlevanson Now that you’re following people your feed will be populated by what they post, what they like and re-tweet. We’ll dive a little deeper into how the feed works a little later. But first: 2.1.1 A note on your own follower count This can’t be stressed enough. Ignore your own follower count. It’s a great boost to ego as your follower number grows, but the benefit you get comes from following other accounts, not who follows you. 🤞 hopes that Hadley follows🤞 You may get some followers yourself but that has no bearing on how much value you’ll get from using Twitter. 2.2 How to unfollow people When you first signed up to Twitter, you were prompted to follow some popular accounts and you can now practice unfollowing on these. First let’s go back to those accounts you followed earlier. Your accounts will be different from these but the steps remain the same. Select your own profile photo on the top left of the screen, this opens your menu. Tap on the “6 Following” number, your number might be different to this. You can unfollow accounts by tapping on the “Following” button. You can also unfollow directly from your feed like this. Look at any tweet from the account you wish to unfollow and tap the little drop-down arrow to the right of the account name. Select Unfollow. Well done! You’re already getting the hang of this. Let’s have a closer look at how your Twitter feed works. "],
["read-the-feed.html", "3 Read the feed 3.1 Someone you follow posts a tweet 3.2 Someone you follow replies to a tweet. 3.3 Retweets 3.4 Liked tweets 3.5 Promoted tweets", " 3 Read the feed So now you’re following some folks. Let’s look at your feed. From time to time Twitter modifies the algorithms for what shows up in your feed. Here are the main ways your feed is populated. P.S. Bear with us here! 3.1 Someone you follow posts a tweet This is the basic way your feed works. Someone you follow posts a tweet, it shows up in you feed. Here, Jesse posted a tweet of her and her cat and it showed in the feed. Jinx's new favorite thing is to crash my video calls. I'm not even mad. pic.twitter.com/kpjYVXUWDO — Jesse Mostipak (@kierisi) February 17, 2020 3.2 Someone you follow replies to a tweet. A reply-tweet from someone you follow will show up in your feed. If you follow both the original poster of the tweet, you’ll see the both the reply, and the orginal tweet being replied to. If a lot of people that you follow reply to a tweet, the the orginal tweet may appear with the thread of replies below it, even if you don’t follow that orginal account that made the tweet. In the example below, David posted a tweet and Nicole replied to it. I used to do this for my summer stats class but don't have any compelling artifacts — Nicole Radziwill (@nicoleradziwill) February 17, 2020 3.3 Retweets Someone you follow re-posts a tweet from someone else a.ka. posts a retweet a.k.a retweets. The retweet can either be with or without their own comment above it. Both options are provided to you when you wish to rewteet Here you can see Mary retweeted Danielle’s tweet. Here’s an example of a quoted retweet. Josiah retweeted Tyler’s tweet, and commented on it. This is seriously so mind boggling. https://t.co/ICZi5ji2xw — Josiah 👨🏻 💻 (@JosiahParry) February 17, 2020 3.4 Liked tweets Someone you follow likes someone else’s tweet. That liked-tweet will be displayed in your feed, even if you don’t follow the account of the person whose tweet was liked. This tweet showed in the feed because Mine and Stoeh liked a tweet from Think&amp;Smile. 3.5 Promoted tweets Advertisments. These have a little “promoted” tweet indicator at the bottom of the post. Anyone can pay to promote their tweets by paying money, but that’s not necessary for you to be concerned with. It’s possible to block these accounts just as you would with any other account if you don’t like the advertiser. "],
["hashtags-what-are-they-good-for.html", "4 #Hashtags, what are they good for? 4.1 #RStats 4.2 #TidyTuesday 4.3 Event hashtags", " 4 #Hashtags, what are they good for? Quite a lot, actually. By now hashtags have found their way across multiple social media platforms. Selecting any hashtag you see will take you to a list of tweets that feature that tag. Some important ones for your R journey are: 4.1 #RStats As a hashtag consisting of just one letter (#R) didn’t quite cut it, the hashtag that was settled on was #rstats. It is probably the most widely used hashtag by the R Twitter community. The hashtag was first used in 2009. RT @ChrisAlbon @drewconway #rstats is the official R statistical language hashtag. #rstats (because #R doesn't cut it) — Michael E. Driscoll (@medriscoll) April 3, 2009 I declare #rstats the official R statistical prog lang hashtag, pass it on to friends, family and Stata users — Drew Conway (@drewconway) April 3, 2009 The @rstatstweet account retweets any tweets that contain the #rstats hashtag. The good thing about this is that your tweet will get more exposure. A possible downside from following the @rstatstweet account is that you might get overwhelmed by the huge amount of tweets that use this hashtag. 4.2 #TidyTuesday Every week there is a Tidy Tuesday challenge posted. It’s a dataset that everyone makes visualisations about and shares their results (and often source code too!). This is a fun way to improve your own skills by learning how others do things and practicing on interesting datasets. Read more about Tidy Tuesday on their Github page. The @R4DScommunity welcomes you to week 7 of #TidyTuesday! We're exploring Hotel Bookings and tidy time-series with {tsibble}!📁 https://t.co/sElb4fcv3u📰 https://t.co/aaRUiVwpku#r4ds #tidyverse #rstats #dataviz pic.twitter.com/QG8QpzCugr — Tom Mock (@thomas_mock) February 10, 2020 4.3 Event hashtags One of the best aspects of Twitter is following news about events and conferences. Of of the most popular is RstudioConf. The hashtag #rstudioconf becomes really active leading up to and during the event. If you’re not attending the conference, following this hashtag gives you an idea of the what’s going on during the conference. Tweets often contain take home messages of talks, screenshots, or links to slides. People attending the conference often use Twitter to meet up for coffee, or to get info on sessions that are cancelled. Other event hashtags: #useR + year, eg. #useR2020 #eRum + year, eg. #eRum2020 #SatRday can't believe #rstudioconf talks are already online!! go watch me laugh at my own jokes for 20 minutes (and also learn a bit about repeated reporting) https://t.co/hfKu1vhNzp — Sharla Gelfand (@sharlagelfand) February 6, 2020 "],
["your-first-tweets.html", "5 Your first tweets 5.1 Enough of the tour, let’s get you tweeting! 5.2 Now try use a hashtag", " 5 Your first tweets 5.1 Enough of the tour, let’s get you tweeting! Select the compose tweet button and start typing: Note that you can’t edit a tweet once it’s posted, unlike many other social media platforms. Don’t worry, everyone has forgooven spellign msiatkes in tweets a long time ago :). You can always add a second tweet with a correction: *mistakes Say anything you want, or if you’re stuck for inspiration say “Yay! My first tweet!”, or the ever famous, “Hello, world!”. Now try another tweet, this time tagging people. Say something like “Hey @veerlevanson @oscarb I’m trying this Twitter thing out.” We’ll both get notifications of your tweet, and are eagerly waiting for it ;). 5.2 Now try use a hashtag “Wow #rstats is awesome!” Now people browsing this hashtag are more likely to see your tweet. You’ll get the hang of this in no-time. We’ll dissect some tweets later, but you get the idea. Just a little tip, limit the use of hashtags to 3 or less in a tweet to keep it legible. Using camel case (#ThisIsCamelCase) makes hashtags more readable, and ensures screen readers pronounce the hashtag as separate words. Make sure you capitalize the first letter of each word in hashtags so that screen reader software reads out each word separately. It also makes them #EasierToRead! https://t.co/ydkRk8eRw0 — RNIB (@RNIB) March 21, 2018 "],
["how-threads-work.html", "6 How threads work", " 6 How threads work Tweet threads are one of the little gems of this microblogging platform. A thread is a string of tweets all linked together by the author and will relate to a topic in some way. When composing a thread, usually people indicate this by starting it with [Thread] or 1/n or some other way to highlight it’s a thread. Here’s how a thread shows up in you feed. What keeps you from contributing to other ppl's (#rstats etc) open-source projects? #thread 1/5I have 3 fears:1. What if my idea doesn't fit w/ the direction of the project?2. What if my implementation doesn't match the project's design?3. What if my style isn't on point? — Benjamin Wolfe (@BenjaminWolfe) February 15, 2020 To make a thread of your own, do this: People can reply to any of the tweets in a thread which starts a mini offshoot thread. This can become a bit confusing if you want to see all replies to a thread, and we basically have to live with it until Twitter finds a way to make this more intuitive. "],

Be comfortable with unfollowing people - be a bit ruthless even. Block people easily - there’s no need for idiots to fill up your feed! 7.1 Mute words This is a really handy feature. Specifying mute words keeps any tweets with those mostly out of your feed.

We’ll introduce some of these to you below. 9.1 Benign bots Tweets are related to things like the weather forecasts, or perhaps some mundane activity that somewhere, someone, finds useful. This bot is tweeting the weather for Utrecht, Netherlands. current weather in Utrecht: few clouds, 9°C70% humidity, wind 10kmh, pressure 1016mb — Utrecht Weather (@_UtrechtNL) February 18, 2020 9.2 Funny bots Tweets are usually humourous or related to some sort of activity like repling to tweets with words replaced by something humorous.

This happens and these accounts are sometimes created to be able to claim the Twitter tag which may have some significance to the owner. Or the owner doesn’t use the account anymore, but never bothered to delete it. "],

This account is run by R-Ladies Global. More information and the application can be found here. 10.2 Scheduling tweets Instead of sending your tweet into the world right away, you can schedule it to be sent out at a specific date and time. Maybe your tweet is about a specific event, and you only want your tweet to appear when the event has started. First, write your tweet like you would normally do. To schedule, click the calendar / clock icon and choose date and time. The Tweet button is now a Schedule button. Click the button and you’re done! Under the calendar / clock icon, you can also select the Scheduled tweets at the bottom to see a list of tweets you’ve scheduled but that haven’t been sent yet. Note: This feature hasn’t been rolled out to all accounts yet. 10.3 Analyzing Twitter data with rtweets Twitter is a great source of data for all sorts of analyses. You can use the excellent rtweet package to access the data. 😍🤓📖 - Just had the pleasure of reading through some of the #rtweet documentation, and boy is it great!!I feel like @kearneymw has really set the gold standard for this one.
